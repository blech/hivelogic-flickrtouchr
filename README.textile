A Python script to grab all your photos from flickr and dump them into a directory, organized into folders by set name.

Original author is "Colm MacCÃ¡rthaigh":http://www.stdlib.net/~colmmacc/.

Changes include tweaks to download full-size original images and improvements in handling UTF8 file and photoset names.

Run it like this:

<pre>
mkdir FlickrBackupFolder
python flickrtouchr.py FlickrBackupFolder
</pre>

You'll be prompted to authorize with Flickr, and then the magic happens.
